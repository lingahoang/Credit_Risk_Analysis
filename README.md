# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis 
In the project, we are helping Jill to employ different techniques in machine learning to solve a real-qorld challenge: credit card risk. Using *imbalanced-learn* and *scikit-learn* libraries, we are building and evaluating models with unbalanced classes. In this analysism, we will use the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, using both method to oversample data and undersample data using different algorithm. Then comparing two machine learning models in order to reduce bias and in the end, predicting risk.  


## Results

### Deliverable 1: Use Resampling Models to Predict Credit Risk



### Deliverable 2: Use the SMOTEENN algorithm to Predict Credit Risk 



### Deliverable 3: Use Ensemble CLassifiers to Predict Credit Risk
